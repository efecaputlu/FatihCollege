            <h4>At Fatih College, we are dedicated to making quality education accessible to all students. Through our inclusive scholarship program, we ensure that every student has the opportunity to excel academically. Scholarships are awarded based on performance in the admission examination and subsequent interviews, allowing us to support a diverse student body. This commitment to equitable education is reflected in our approach to covering tuition and boarding house fees. Boarding students contribute to both fees, while day students only cover tuition expenses. To accommodate families' financial situations, we provide the option to pay fees in three installments at the start of each term, making education more manageable and accessible for everyone.</h4>
